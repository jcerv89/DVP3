 

## Project & Portfolio 1

The GIT repo is used for version control, a place to back up and store work in the event it is lost locally, and getting familiar with the use of GIT in the terminal. The coding challenges will be completed and changed often. Previous project will be pushed soon for refactoring.

### Updates to commits:
10/30/2018 - Coding challenge has built menu with some custom classes designated. The swap name program is in progress. Many updates and commits to come in the neare future. Check the repo daily for changes and updates.

### Coding challenges:
The menu gives the options of the program to run. Select the number of the apllicaton you wish to use. The exit option will close the application.

The Swap Name will simply switch the order of the names that you enter. For example, if John Smith is entered, Smith John will output as well.

The Backwards will display the user text backwards. If ABC is entered, CBA will output. Keep in mind it requires at least 6 words to be entered, or user will be prompted to do it again in order to display results.

The age converter is complete. It will give your age in days, hours, minutes and seconds. A .ToString method was added so the larger numbers are easier to read.

The temp converter works for fahrenheit and celcius conversion. Expect a kelvin conversion in the near future. Currently will only give conversions for celcius and fahrenheit. 

The Big Blue Fish will give you the largest size fish of the color selected. There will be an addition that will find the smallest fish of the selected color.

### Refacoted SDI Code
There are two programs of previous SDI code that have been either cleaned up or improved in some fashion. These are used for continuous learning with trial and error. More of these kinds of programs will be added in the future.
